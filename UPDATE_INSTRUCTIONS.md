# Implementation and Update Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions for updating the Scoras GitHub repository with the improved package structure and implementation.

## Overview of Changes

The improved Scoras library includes the following key enhancements:

1. **Proper Package Structure**: Reorganized files into a standard Python package structure that follows best practices
2. **Enhanced Scoring System**: Developed a mathematically rigorous foundation for the complexity scoring
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed explanations of the scoring system's mathematical basis
4. **Extensive Tests**: Created proper test coverage for all functionality
5. **Modern Packaging**: Added pyproject.toml for compatibility with modern Python packaging tools
6. **Example Files**: Created comprehensive examples demonstrating all library features

## Step-by-Step Update Instructions

Follow these steps to update your GitHub repository with the improved Scoras package:

### 1. Backup Your Current Repository (Optional)

```bash
# Clone your repository to a backup location
git clone https://github.com/scorastecnologialtda/scoras.git scoras-backup
```

### 2. Clean Your Current Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd scoras

# Remove all current files (except .git directory)
find . -mindepth 1 -not -path "*/\.git*" -delete
```

### 3. Copy the Improved Files

Copy all the files from the improved Scoras package to your repository:

```bash
# Copy all files from the improved package
cp -r /path/to/scoras_improved/* /path/to/your/scoras/
```

### 4. Review the Structure

Ensure your repository now has the following structure:

```

### 5. Commit and Push the Changes

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Completely restructured package to fix installation issues and enhance scoring system"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a New Release

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/scorastecnologialtda/scoras
2. Click on "Releases" on the right sidebar
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Tag version: v0.2.0
5. Release title: "Version 0.2.0 - Major Restructuring and Enhancements"
6. Description: Add release notes describing the improvements (see below)
7. Click "Publish release"

**Suggested Release Notes:**

```
# Scoras v0.2.0 - Major Restructuring and Enhancements

This release completely restructures the Scoras package to fix installation issues and significantly enhances the library's functionality.

## Major Changes

- Fixed package structure to ensure proper installation via pip and uv
- Developed a mathematically rigorous foundation for the complexity scoring system
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining the scoring system
- Created extensive test coverage for all functionality
- Added support for Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Added support for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
- Improved agent, RAG, and tool implementations
- Added example files demonstrating all library features

## Installation

```bash
pip install scoras
```

or

```bash
uv pip install scoras
```
```

### 7. Publish to PyPI

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Navigate to your repository
cd scoras

# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

You'll be prompted for your PyPI username and password.

### 8. Verify Installation

After publishing, verify that your package can be installed:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: test-env\Scripts\activate

# Install with pip
pip install scoras

# Or install with uv
uv pip install scoras

# Test import
python -c "import scoras; print(scoras.__version__)"
```

## Key Improvements Details

### Package Structure

The package now follows standard Python packaging best practices:

- Proper module hierarchy with `__init__.py` files
- Separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Tests in their own directory
- Examples in a separate directory
- Modern packaging with both setup.py and pyproject.toml

### Scoring System

The scoring system now has a rigorous mathematical foundation:

- Each component (node, edge, tool, condition) contributes to an overall complexity score
- Scores are calculated using graph theory principles
- Complexity ratings range from "Simple" to "Extremely Complex"
- Detailed breakdowns show which components contribute most to complexity

See `docs/scoring_mathematical_foundation.md` for a detailed explanation.

### Protocol Support

The library now includes comprehensive support for:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Enables Scoras agents to act as MCP clients and servers
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**: Enables communication between agents across different frameworks

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the update process:

1. Ensure all files are copied correctly
2. Check that the package structure matches the expected structure
3. Verify that all dependencies are installed
4. Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly: `pytest scoras/tests/`

For any persistent issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
